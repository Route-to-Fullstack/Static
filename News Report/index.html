          <h1>Elon Musk Buys Twitter</h1>
          <p>Elon Musk struck a deal on Monday to buy Twitter for roughly $44 billion, in a victory by the world’s richest man to take over the influential social network frequented by world leaders, celebrities and cultural trendsetters.

            Twitter agreed to sell itself to Mr. Musk for $54.20 a share, a 38 percent premium over the company’s share price this month before he revealed he was the firm’s single largest shareholder.</p>

            <p>French astronaut Thomas Pesquet spent six months aboard the International Space Station last year, and his view of the Earth was as alarming as it was breathtaking.

              Long periods with his feet off solid ground gave him a unique and privileged perspective on our planet. His Instagram account is bursting with beautiful images of "the blue ball we call home." But the beauty is tainted. Pesquet says that even from space the effects of climate change are visible.</p>

It's a far cry from the shelled apartment buildings of her home city of Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine.
