          <p>Elon Musk escalated a public feud with Twitter's CEO early Tuesday, saying his acquisition of the social media company "cannot move forward" until he sees more information about the prevalence of spam accounts.

            Without citing a source, Musk claimed in a tweet that Twitter is "20% fake/spam accounts" and suggested Twitter's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission were misleading. The company has said that less than 5% of its daily active users are spam accounts.
            "My offer was based on Twitter's SEC filings being accurate," Musk tweeted. "Yesterday, Twitter's CEO publicly refused to show proof of <5%. This deal cannot move forward until he does."
            Musk doubled down later in the day, publishing a Twitter poll to his more than 93 million followers with the prompt: "Twitter claims that >95% of daily active users are real, unique humans. Does anyone have that experience?"
            He also tagged the SEC's verified Twitter handle in a subsequent tweet. He appeared to invite the regulator, with whom he has clashed in the past, to look into the matter by asking, "anyone home?"</p>
          <p>The latest tweets from Musk appeared to cast more doubt on the $44 billion deal. Musk on Friday declared it was "temporarily on hold" but that he's "still committed to acquisition." That pivot from Musk fueled speculation that the world's richest man may be using the debate over bots to secure a better price for Twitter, either as a negotiating tactic or out of necessity.
            Twitter's shares were down 1.7% in premarket trading Tuesday. The stock has erased all its gains in the weeks since Musk disclosed his stake the company and is now trading at $36.80 per share â€” well below Musk's offer price of $54.20 per share.
            "Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable," the company said in a statement Tuesday.
            On Monday, Musk exchanged a series of tweets with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal about the spam account issue.</p>
